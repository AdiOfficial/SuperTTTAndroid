# Super Tic Tac Toe Android [![master Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/henrykvdb/SuperTTTAndroid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/henrykvdb/SuperTTTAndroid)

In Super Tic Tac Toe (also known as Ultimate Tic Tac Toe or Meta TTT) each square of the traditional board contains a smaller tic tac toe board. Two players take turns playing the smaller boards until one of them wins three in a row.

Changes and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to open a pull request if you have any improvements in mind.
